The main program is located in Main.java, so please run that when testing. Puzzle.java is how I am defining a Puzzle Object.
There are two different ways to input a puzzle, manually number by number, or by a test file.

NOTE: I am choosing to represent a black as a '0' symbol.

Method 1: Manually
Please enter numbers separated by a single space. See example below.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F 0

Method 2: Test File
You will be prompted to enter a file name, it should be in the correct directory.
The file format must be...
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F 0
